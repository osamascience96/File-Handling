# Read and write files

# Writing the files 
fw = open('sample.txt', 'w') # open the file (create if not created) and write in the stream of file in memory
fw.write('This is a file to write \n')
fw.write('Brother of my sweet niece is born today\n')
fw.close() # best practice to close the file after reading or writing (otherwise python will close it for you)

# Reading the files 
fr = open('sample.txt', 'r') # object for reading the file 
text = fr.read()
fr.close() # close stream of file in memory and save to hdd
print(text)
